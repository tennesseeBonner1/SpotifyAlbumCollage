# SpotifyAlbumCollage
Python App that pulls album covers from a user's liked songs and assembles them in a collage. The collage is a 1920x1080 png, saved to an images folder within the project.

This project uses the Spotify API to request all of a users liked songs. Because of this, it 
currently requires an Oauth token. This token can be generated by requesting a token at the 
developer site for spotify under 'Get User's Saved Tracks': https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-current-user-saved-tracks/.
This Oauth token needs to be manually entered in the 'SPOTIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN' global variable in spotify_functions.py
